##Hello! I’m Jasmine, and here is a picture of me and my sweet kitten, Papa.   		  

####A few years ago, I tried teaching myself how to code HTML with the help from Codecademy. I didn’t complete any specific course because I was in school during that time, but I had the interest to learn. I actually just graduated in the spring ’20 from SUNY New Paltz with a Bachelor’s Degree in Philosophy. I wanted to pursue something more pragmatic, and with my previous interest in Computer Science, and the fact that SUNY New Paltz has a Computer Science Graduate program, I took a leap to pursue a new career. Last fall was my first semester in the Graduate Computer Science program here at New Paltz, and I took ‘Database Designs’, ‘Computer Systems’ and ‘Programming and Data Structures’. To help myself through those courses and the courses I’m taking this semester (this course, ‘Machine Learning’, and ‘Cloud Systems and Applications’), I have completed a number of courses on LinkedIn Learning on subjects such as HTML, CSS, Java, Python, JavaScript, Data Structures & Algorithms, Git and GitHub. 


####I have always had an interest in how computers work and the underlying software of all types of computer systems and applications. As of now, I’m not entirely sure what area of computer science I would like to pursue (career-wise). I think this course will teach me a lot about web applications and allow me to be a multifaceted asset to any workplace once I graduate. I love to learn, so learning about all the different areas of computer science will help me find something that I love and excel at, and I think this subject matter we’re covering in this course will be that for me. I’m very excited to be taking this course and looking forward to learning a lot! :)
